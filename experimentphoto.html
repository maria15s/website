<h1>All About Photography</h1>
<img id="cameras" src="https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w1200/upload/8a/cd/04/shutterstock-599128478.jpg" alt="Progress Of Photography">
<div id="container">
    <p style="font-size: 50px;">The Beginning</p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.5;"> Photography began in the late 1830's, starting in France. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce 
        used a camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This was the first image
        that didn't fade quickly. His success led to a number of other 
        people's experiments and then photography started to progress faster.Niépce's success led to
        a number of other experiments and photography progressed very rapidly.
        Daguerreotypes, emulsion plates, and wet plates were developed almost simultaneously in the mid- to late-1800s.
        With each type of emulsion, photographers experimented with different chemicals and techniques. The following 
        are the three that were instrumental in the development of modern photography.

<h1>More Improved</h1>

<div id="holder">
    <p style="font-size: 50px;">Daguerreotype</p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.5;">Niépce's experiment led to a collaboration with Louis Daguerre. The result was the creation 
        of the daguerreotype, a forerunner of modern film.
        <br>
        A copper plate was coated with silver and exposed to iodine vapor before it was exposed to light.
        <br>
        To create the image on the plate, the early daguerreotypes had to be exposed to light for up to 15 minutes.
        <br>
        The daguerreotype was very popular until it was replaced in the late 1850s by emulsion plates.

<h1>The Plates</h1>
<img id="emersionplates" src="https://kimon.hosting.nyu.edu/physical-electrical-digital/files/original/abb3d930ef1187ce581b8f62afd97ad2.jpg" alt="emersionplates">
<div id="table">
    <p style="font-size: 50px;">Emulsion Plates</p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.5;">Emulsion plates, or wet plates, were less expensive than 
        daguerreotypes and required only two or three seconds of exposure time. 
        This made them much more suited to portrait photographs, which was the most common use of
        photography at the time. Many photographs from the Civil War were produced on wet plates.

        These wet plates used an emulsion process called the Collodion process, 
        rather than a simple coating on the image plate. It was during this time 
        that bellows were added to cameras to help with focusing.
        
        Two common types of emulsion plates were the ambrotype and the tintype. 
        Ambrotypes used a glass plate instead of the copper plate of the daguerreotypes.
        Tintypes used a tin plate. While these plates were much more sensitive to light,they
        had to be developed quickly. Photographers needed to have chemistry on head
        and many traveled in wagons that doubled as a darkroom.

<h1>Cameras All Around</h1>

<div id="extra">
    <p style="font-size: 50px;">The Future of Cameras</p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.5;">Photography was only for professionals and the very rich until 
        George Eastman started a company called Kodak in the 1880s.

        Eastman created a flexible roll film that did not require constantly changing the solid plates. 
        This allowed him to develop a self-contained box camera that held 100 film exposures.
         The camera had a small single lens with no focusing adjustment.
        
        The consumer would take pictures and send the camera back to the factory for the film 
        to be developed and prints made, much like modern disposable cameras. This was the first
         camera inexpensive enough for the average person to afford.
        
        The film was still large in comparison to today's 35mm film. It was not until 
        the late 1940s that 35mm film became cheap enough for the majority of consumers to use.
