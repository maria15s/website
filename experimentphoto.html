<h1>All About Photography</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 50px;">The Beginning</p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.5;"> Photography began in the late 1830's, starting in France. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce 
        used a camera obscura to expose a pewter plate coated with bitumen to light. This was the first image
        that didn't fade quickly. His success led to a number of other 
        people's experiments and then photography started to progress faster.Niépce's success led to
        a number of other experiments and photography progressed very rapidly.
        Daguerreotypes, emulsion plates, and wet plates were developed almost simultaneously in the mid- to late-1800s.
        With each type of emulsion, photographers experimented with different chemicals and techniques. The following 
        are the three that were instrumental in the development of modern photography.

<h1>First Step</h1>

<div id="container">
    <p style="font-size: 50px;">Daguerreotype</p>
    <p style="line-height: 2.5;">Niépce's experiment led to a collaboration with Louis Daguerre. The result was the creation 
        of the daguerreotype, a forerunner of modern film.
        <br>
        A copper plate was coated with silver and exposed to iodine vapor before it was exposed to light.
        <br>
        To create the image on the plate, the early daguerreotypes had to be exposed to light for up to 15 minutes.
        <br>
        The daguerreotype was very popular until it was replaced in the late 1850s by emulsion plates.
